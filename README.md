# ECHO – Modular Prompt Framework for When Things Break

ECHO isn’t a tool. It’s an infrastructure born from a mess: the chaos that exploded when everyone with Slack started AI-prompting without any structure.

This repo shares the **public side** of that system:

- Core component structure  
- Recipe typology and examples  
- Use cases that reflect real breakdowns  
- A clear line on what’s behind the curtain

## Because prompts became infrastructure when nobody was looking

You didn’t notice it at first. Then you realized your prompt logic was scattered, half-baked, undocumented and then it broke. That’s when structure isn’t optional anymore.

ECHO doesn’t promise better AI. It promises prompts that *don’t crumble under pressure*.

## Who this actually helps

- Prompt designers trapped in version chaos  
- Dev teams building internal AI tooling fast and needing governance  
- Leaders who’ve seen tone wars erupt across brand communications  
- Anyone who spent nights chasing down prompt mishaps

If you've ever thought: “Something needs to change before it all collapses,” ECHO’s for you.

## What this *doesn’t* cover

Internal scoring algorithms  
Metadata blueprints  
Prompt lifecycle automation  
Hidden logic systems or proprietary recipes

Those are still under wraps. Want in? Reach out.
